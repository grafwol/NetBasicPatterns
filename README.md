# NetBasicPatterns
Basic implementations for the .NET world of some common problems occurring to me

Every time in a new project we are facing the same basic problems.
___Ehh? need logging - fast___
___need units - fast___


This is a very small collection of some basic patterns developed and evolved in different
contextes. 
None of this implementations will be good enough if you have specific requirements
this will not be more then an inspiration.

As said in the license : Copy, redistribute, use the software as it is but
mention me (I've seen too many times people walking around carrying the ideas
of others as their own).

If you like what you see : let me know.
